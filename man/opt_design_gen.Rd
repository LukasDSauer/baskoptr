\usage{
opt_design_gen(
  design,
  utility,
  algorithm,
  detail_params,
  utility_params,
  algorithm_params,
  trace = FALSE,
  x_names = NULL,
  fn_name = "fn"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{fujikawa} created by the function
\code{baskwrap::setup_fujikawa_x} or \code{basksim::setup_fujikawa}.}

\item{utility}{A function returning the utility of a parameter combination
\code{x} of the form \code{utility(design, x, detail_params, ...)}, where \code{...} may
further parameters to be supplied to the utility.}

\item{algorithm}{A function returning the optimization algorithm's results,
should have the form \code{algorithm(fn, ...)}, where \code{fn} is the
function to be optimized and \code{...} may be further parameters of the
optimization algorithm.}

\item{detail_params}{A named list of parameters that need to be supplied to
\code{get_details()}.}

\item{utility_params}{A named list of further parameters that need to be
supplied to  the utility function.}

\item{algorithm_params}{A named list of further parameters that need to be
supplied to the optimization algorithm.}

\item{trace}{A logical or a character string, should the trace of the
optimization algorithm be recorded? Default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, recording
is done by dynamic appending of a data frame (which may not be
very efficient). If \code{trace} is a character vector specifying a file path,
the trace will be dynamically saved to an RDS file.
Some optimization algorithms automatically return their
trace. In that case, you can switch off using \code{trace = FALSE} (or \code{""} or
\code{NULL}) and request the trace directly from your algorithm using
\code{algorith_params}.}

\item{x_names}{A character vector containing the names of the utility functions
tuning parameters, automatically retrieved from \code{algorithm_params$par} or
\code{algorithm_params$lower} if either is present. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{fn_name}{The name of the function argument of \code{algorithm}. The
default is \code{"fn"}.}
}
\value{
a list consisting of the algorithm's output (usually the optimal
parameter vector and the resulting optimal utility value and some meta
information). If \code{trace == TRUE}, the trace of the optimization algorithm
can be found in the \verb{[["trace"]]} argument of the list. (This overwrites
any \verb{[["trace"]]} argument in the algorithm's output.)
}
\description{
Optimize the parameters of a basket trial design using a utility-based
approach with a simulation algorithm of your choice.
